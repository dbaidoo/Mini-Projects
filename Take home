Problem
This dataset is from an experiment on how plants adapt to cold climates. The investigators decided to study
this problem after observing that plants that have been conditioned to cold previously appear to suffer less
damage from the cold. Two species of potato were studied (species 1 and 2). Each plant was exposed to one
of two acclimatization regimes (1= plant was kept in cold room; 0= plant was kept at room temperature)
for several days. Later, plants were subjected to one of two cold temperatures (-4 degrees C is coded as 1;
-8 degrees C is coded as 2). Two responses were measured: damage score for photosynthesis (photo), and
damage score for ion leakage (leak). In this project, you will use ion leakage to be the response variable. Some
of the 80 plants originally assigned to the treatment combinations were lost during the experiment. The task
is to analyze the data from the plants that made it through, and assess the effects of the three experimental
factors species, regime, and temperature on the response ion leakage.
